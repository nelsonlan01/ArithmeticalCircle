# Arithmetical Circle

The "Arithmetical Circle" is a python tool and API function that proposed to contribute and extend code in `math` dot functions.

"Arithmetical Circle" is a pure mathematical abstract but useful concept and algorithm that is researched and implemented by Nelson, LAN. Gratefully, there was a local maths competition that provide me with this mystery.

Which contain 4 different aspects to calculate numbers in different similar but work out completely distinctive answers.

They are included with prefixes -- "Arithmetical Circle". "Arithmetical Circle add", "subtract", "multiply", "division".

For that theory and concept, we assume one example was given on top of the paper (`pdf` file), where the realm started. 

Single, and step-by-step proof to build up this logic and algorithm from ground zero; using proved statements to expand to different aspects of calculation; finally making the product ("Arithmetical Circle").
